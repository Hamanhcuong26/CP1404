_Edit this README, replacing this line and above with your own name/details._  
_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get high marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
It take me more time than A1. I must do it nearly 2 days for completed without any eror.
Note: You may like to use the WakaTime plugin, which tracks exactly how long you spend in code. See http://wakatime.com (but note that the free version only has a 7-day history)

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
I am really satisfied with my program because everything worked properly as I expected.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
Combining a python program and kivy is not that easy.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
I managed to solve all the problems that I have encountered when doing the code.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
I hope that I am able to do coding better in the future.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
I watched videos on Youtube mostly to help me understand kivy more deeply.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
I did not really understand about kivy at the first time, but I managed to overcome my weakness by learning more
serious.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
It is quite useful.
